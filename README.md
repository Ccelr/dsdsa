Have you ever wanted to blow something up? Or maybe you always dreamt of operating an atomic power plant? Do you have a will to develop your own CPU? The Powder Toy lets you to do all of these, and even more!

The Powder Toy is a free physics sandbox game, which simulates air pressure and velocity, heat, gravity and a countless number of interactions between different substances! The game provides you with various building materials, liquids, gases and electronic components which can be used to construct complex machines, guns, bombs, realistic terrains and almost anything else. You can then mine them and watch cool explosions, add intricate wirings, play with little stickmen or operate your machine. You can browse and play thousands of different saves made by the community or upload your own â€“ we welcome your creations!

There is a Lua API â€“ you can automate your work or even make plugins for the game. The Powder Toy is free and the source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License, so you can modify the game yourself or help with development. TPT is compiled using scons.

Animal creature guide.


Press D/f13 to show advanced properties to see detailed information about each cell
PROP tool to change specific properties

Biology and chemistry properties
energy(tmpcity[3])
health(tmp3)
nutrients(carbons)
oxygen(oxygens)
CO2(hydrogens)
kinda of waste atm(nitrogens)
water(water)

metabolism speed property = lower is faster
everytime tick count / metabolism == 0, cell uses 1 oxygens + 1 carbons to make 1 energy.

energy capacity is 100
if energy > 99, uses 1 water and 1 energy 
if energy < 1 or water < 1, takes 1 health of damage.
if health < 1, dies and decays into BCTR or other stuff

Animal cells  have diffusion properties, mixing the properties on contact.
WATR, HCL and OIL have similar properties, but they can dissolve solids and other things as well, like SUGR or FLSH.

LUNG with O2 to absorb and to release CO2. If totally sealed, CO2 will build up on the closed lung and suffocate it overtime.

STMH preferably sealed because the HCL(also produces WATR) it produces damages anything other than STMH.
Absorbs nutriens, oxygen and water from WATR and HCL on contact,

POPS on the bottom to release excess and waste materials/properties. Each combination of excess properties(water, oxygens, carbons, nitrogens, hydrogens) will yield a different waste material. Eg, carbons + water = OIL. carbons + oxygens = GAS(pretty arbitrary rn)

BVSL and BLOD are used for better transport of the properties(water, oxygens, carbons, nitrogens, hydrogens) faster and better for distribution. if BVSL surrounded by 2 more BVLS, it turns into BLOD inside the BVSL.
BLOD color indicates it's contents, more RED = O2, more BLUE = nutrients, more GREEN = CO2
